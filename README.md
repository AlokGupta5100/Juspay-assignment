# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Clone the Repository
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Run the following command to clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
Replace <repository-url> with the URL of the GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git).

Navigate to the cloned project folder:
cd <project-folder-name>

2. Install Node.js
Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not:

Download and install it from nodejs.org.
Prefer the LTS version for better stability.
Confirm the installation:

node -v
npm -v
Alternatively, you can use yarn if it's set up on your system.

3. Install Project Dependencies
Run the following command to install dependencies:
npm install
If you're using Yarn:
yarn install
4. Run the Development Server
Start the Vite development server:

npm run dev
Or with Yarn:

yarn dev
The terminal will display a local development URL, usually something like:

âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
Open the provided URL in your web browser to see the app running.

5. Optional: Build and Serve
To build the project for production:

npm run build
Or:

yarn build
To preview the production build:

npm run preview
